# React roadmap

## 1. The Core Fundamentals

- Start with the basics. Don't assume you know these; instead, be ready to explain them in detail.

- JSX: Understand what it is (syntactic sugar for React.createElement()), why it's used, and how it gets transpiled. Explain its benefits, such as making UI code more readable.

- Virtual DOM & Reconciliation: This is a crucial concept. Explain what the Virtual DOM isâ€”an in-memory representation of the real DOM. Then, describe the reconciliation process (also known as "diffing") where React compares the new and old virtual DOM trees to find the most efficient way to update the real DOM. Be prepared to discuss the performance benefits of this approach.

- Components: Differentiate clearly between functional components and class components. Understand the shift towards functional components with Hooks and be able to explain why they are preferred for new projects.

- State and Props: Articulate the one-way data flow. Props are immutable and passed from parent to child. State is local, mutable, and triggers a re-render when it changes. Be ready to explain "prop drilling" and how to solve it.

- Component Lifecycle: For functional components, understand how the useEffect Hook maps to the lifecycle of a component (mounting, updating, unmounting). Be prepared to discuss the useEffect dependency array and its importance in preventing infinite loops.

## 2. Hooks: The Modern React Way

- Hooks are central to modern React, and interviewers will test your knowledge of them extensively.

- useState: Explain its purpose and how to use it for managing state. Discuss the concept of a state updater function.

- useEffect: This is one of the most important Hooks. Explain its use for handling side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, and manual DOM manipulation. Be very clear about the cleanup function it can return and its relationship with the dependency array.

- useContext: Explain the Context API as a solution for managing global state and avoiding prop drilling. Be ready to walk through a basic example of a Provider and a Consumer using useContext.

- useRef: Differentiate useRef from useState. Explain its use for creating mutable references that persist across renders without causing a re-render. Common use cases include accessing a DOM element or storing a value that doesn't need to be in state.

- useMemo and useCallback: These are for performance optimization. Explain what memoization is.

useMemo memoizes a value to prevent expensive calculations from running on every re-render.

useCallback memoizes a function to prevent it from being recreated on every re-render, which is crucial for passing functions to memoized child components.

- Custom Hooks: Be prepared to create a simple custom Hook to abstract a piece of reusable logic. Explain the "rules of Hooks."

## 3. Practical Knowledge & Optimization

Interviewers want to see that you can apply your knowledge to real-world problems.

- Performance Optimization: Discuss strategies to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Mention React.memo for functional components and the importance of using keys for list rendering.

- Forms: Explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components. Argue why controlled components are generally the preferred approach for handling form input in React.

- Routing: Be familiar with a popular routing library like React Router. Know how to set up routes, use a BrowserRouter, and navigate between pages using Link or useNavigate.

- State Management: Beyond Context, have a high-level understanding of when and why you might use a more robust state management library like Redux or Zustand. You don't need to be an expert, but you should know their purpose.

- Testing: Mention your experience with a testing library like React Testing Library and a framework like Jest. Discuss the importance of testing components and how you would approach it.

4. Advanced Concepts & Patterns
   For senior-level interviews, these topics will differentiate you.

Advanced Patterns: Know what Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props are. While less common with Hooks, they are classic patterns and show a deeper understanding of React's evolution.

Error Boundaries: Explain what an Error Boundary is and how it helps catch JavaScript errors in your component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the application.

- Concurrent Mode: Have a basic understanding of React's Concurrent Mode (introduced in React 18) and its core features like automatic batching, startTransition, and useDeferredValue. Explain how these features improve the user experience by allowing React to interrupt and resume rendering.
